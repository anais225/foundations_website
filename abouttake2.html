            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The idea comes from a project done in another University where a group of students developed a device that uses conductive properties of the human body and the fact that each electromechanical object has unique electromagnetic vibrations to learn to recognize touched objects.

                A simple example of this is touching a stove with your hand and the device knowing you touched a stove.
                
                Their project worked with 27 different devices and our idea is to recreate the device and the machine learning system and explore the scope of its opportunities as we see great potential in using this technology to develop an accessibility tool for people with vision and memory problems.</p>
